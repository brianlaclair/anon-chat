## features

## setup
1. Clone the repo
2. Serve on a server that can run PHP
3. Done! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

## how to use
browse to the directory on the server you cloned it to! 
You'll find a welcome page with a link to [yourserver/anon-chat]/Welcome

Chatrooms are defined by browsing to them - for example, if we wanted to start a new chatroom called "IAmSoCool", all you have to do is go to [yourserver/anon-chat]/IAmSoCool

you can find a live demo at: https://www.brianlaclair.com/experiments/anon-chat/

## bugs
- Chatbox is not currently scrollable due to flexbox inconsistencies

## future stuff?
- harden submissions script
- add BBcode support
